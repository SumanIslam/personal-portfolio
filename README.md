## Introduction
This is the first website that I made when I started Web development. It's a personal fortfolio project. I used HTML and CSS for this project. I learned a lot doing this project. I still remember that moment when I finished the project, It takes couple of days to complete and my happiness bounds no limit. It always a great pleasure to complete a project or solving problems. I had difficulties to complete as I was newbie that time and it made me think what to do to come out with a solution.
